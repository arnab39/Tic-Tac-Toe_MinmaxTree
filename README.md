# Tic-Tac-Toe with Minmax Tree
A naive implementation of Minmax Algorithm to design a basic Tic-Tac-Toe solver.
Run the code to play with your computer or to determine the best move given a state of the board.
Feel free to contribute to this work to augment the performance of the AI.(you can probably add alpha beta pruning)
Or Use it for your own hobby project.( some complex games maybe)
